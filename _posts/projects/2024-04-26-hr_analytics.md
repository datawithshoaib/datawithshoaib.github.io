### Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI Desktop. The dashboard is designed to provide key insights into HR metrics, including staff composition, salary analysis, and leave balance trends. The goal is to help HR teams and business leaders make data-driven decisions that improve employee management and organizational efficiency.

### Introduction
In this project, I built a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard that provides detailed insights into various HR metrics. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for understanding the workforce's structure, salary distribution, and trends in employee growth and leave balances.

The project was completed through the following steps:

#### Loading and Cleaning Data:
- Imported the dataset into Power BI Desktop.
- Cleaned and prepared the data using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency.

#### Creating HR Metrics:
- Developed key HR metrics such as headcount, average salary, average leave balance, and more to facilitate detailed analysis.
- Salary and Qualification Comparison:
    - Analyzed the relationship between salary levels and educational qualifications to identify trends and correlations.

#### Customizing Visuals:
- Customized Power BI visuals, including adjustments to colors, axis labels, and legends, to enhance readability and user experience.

#### DAX Calculations:
- Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create advanced metrics, such as cumulative headcount and identifying employees with leave balances exceeding 20 days.

#### Designing the Dashboard:
- Designed a user-friendly HR dashboard that presents the insights in an accessible and visually appealing manner.
