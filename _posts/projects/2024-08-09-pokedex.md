# Pokedex Project üïπÔ∏è

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Pokedex using Power BI. The goal was to replicate the visuals and functionality of the original Pokedex from the Pok√©mon series. The project connects to an online Pok√©mon database to retrieve images and uses a Kaggle dataset for detailed Pok√©mon information, all integrated into a custom-designed Pokedex interface.

## Introduction
The Pokedex is an iconic tool from the Pok√©mon series, providing detailed information on every Pok√©mon. In this project, I recreated the Pokedex using Power BI, combining visuals, interactivity, and data integration to deliver an experience similar to the original Pokedex.

## Data Sources
Pok√©mon Database Website: Used to retrieve images for each Pok√©mon.
Kaggle Dataset: Provided comprehensive information on Pok√©mon, including stats, types, abilities, and more.

## Steps Followed
The project was completed through the following steps:

### Connecting to Data Sources:
- Connected to the Pok√©mon database website to fetch images for each Pok√©mon.
- Imported and cleaned the Kaggle dataset containing detailed Pok√©mon information using Power Query.

### Designing the Pokedex Interface:
- Created a custom background in Power BI to mimic the original Pokedex interface.
- Integrated images and data into this interface, aligning visuals and information to replicate the classic Pokedex look.

### Data Integration and Visualization:
- Merged Pok√©mon images with the dataset to display them alongside their respective stats and information.
- Customized visuals to ensure they fit within the Pokedex interface, maintaining the aesthetic and functionality of the original tool.

### Interactivity Implementation:
- Added interactive features to allow users to search and filter Pok√©mon by various criteria, such as name, species, abilities and type.

### Pokedex Features
The Power BI Pokedex includes the following features:

- Detailed Pok√©mon Profiles: Displays information such as type, abilities and stats for each Pok√©mon.
- Visual Replication: The interface is designed to look and feel like the original Pokedex, complete with matching colors and layouts.
- Interactive Search and Filter: Users can interactively search for Pok√©mon by name, type, or other criteria.
- Dynamic Visuals: Images of Pok√©mon are displayed dynamically as users explore the Pokedex, enhancing the user experience.

## Conclusion
This Pokedex project demonstrates the power of Power BI in creating visually engaging and interactive tools. By combining data from various sources and replicating the Pokedex interface, I was able to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing dashboard similar to the original Pokedex.
