I have been using Excel for a while but I haven't created a dashboard in Excel. I used Excel mostly for cleaning and simple data transformations. So, I thought why not create a dashboard to improve my Excel skills. I went to YouTube to look for some simple dashboard for practice, and I came across Chandoo's playlist called Free Data Analyst Course.

I have gone through all of the Excel videos, his videos are really good to understand all the important aspects of Excel.
