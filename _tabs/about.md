Hi, I’m Shoaib, currently working as a Data Analyst with 2.3 years of experience.

What excites me most is finding meaningful patterns in data and using them to tell compelling stories that lead to data-driven improvements. I’m always eager to learn and explore new tools, and technologies in the data science domain.

I am proficient in key data tools such as Power BI, Python, SQL and Excel, and I have a strong interest in data analysis, data transformation, data visualization, ETL, and analytical problem-solving.

As a Data Analyst, I’ve developed Power BI reports and successfully delivered insights that had a direct impact on decision-making. Whether it’s building interactive Power BI dashboards or writing efficient Python scripts for data wrangling, I am passionate about leveraging data to bring value to businesses.
